# Josephus-Problem
Josephus is an old problem attributed to the 1st century Jewish historian Josephus.
He and 40 of his fellow soldiers are imprisoned in a cave surrounded by the Romans. They prefer suicide to being captured and decide to form a circle and kill themselves three by three. Since Josephus does not want to be killed, and can find a safe place outside the circle, he and one of his companions survive and join the Romans who capture them. (The only thing Josephus said later was that by luck or by the grace of God, he and another person survived and surrendered to the Romans.)
We will consider this problem with two different functions. The first takes n as the number of people in the circle and k as the number of jumps. Then, using a loop, it creates a list of the order in which people are killed.
The second function again takes n and k and in addition to them, it also takes a variable called p and checks again in the same way how many people that person (p) dies.
These two functions were two methods that I thought could be tested.
If you see a problem that was interesting, I would be happy to let me know.
